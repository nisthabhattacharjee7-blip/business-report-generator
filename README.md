## Business Metrics Generated

The pipeline automatically calculates:

- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue per Order
- Top Selling Product
- Revenue by Product
- Revenue by Category
- Category-wise Product Count
- SQL-based Revenue Analytics

---

## Data Cleaning Operations

The cleaning system performs:

- Duplicate removal
- Missing value handling
- Invalid datatype correction
- Negative value filtering
- Numeric conversion for analysis

---

## Database Operations

SQLite integration supports:

- Database creation
- Table creation
- Data insertion
- SQL analytics queries
- Persistent structured storage

---

## Advanced SQL Analytics

The project performs advanced SQL operations using:

- GROUP BY
- ORDER BY
- SUM()
- COUNT()

---

## Example SQL Queries

### Revenue by Category

```sql
SELECT category,
SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### Top Selling Products

```sql
SELECT product,
SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```

### Product Count by Category

```sql
SELECT category,
COUNT(*) AS total_products
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;
```

---

## Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard includes:

- Interactive KPI cards
- Sidebar category filters
- Revenue visualizations
- Interactive data tables
- Real-time filtered analytics
- Business insights dashboard UI

---

## Data Visualizations

Automatically generated charts include:

- Revenue by Product Bar Chart
- Revenue by Category Bar Chart
- Revenue Distribution Pie Chart

All generated visual outputs are stored inside:

```text
output/
```

---
